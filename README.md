#### Tests
`$ rspec`

#### Design
###### Modelling the grid
At the outset I chose to model the grid as a 2D array. This worked well until I wanted to implement the fill tool, which seemed to require a more graph-like data structure where each node is able to query the nodes around it. I briefly experimented with such a data structure but ultimately decided against it. Unfortunately this meant that the `Fill` shape needs to have access to the canvas to ensure it doesn't modify already-filled points.
###### CLI
I wanted to entirely decouple the Draw program from the means by which the user would enter input. I have done this using a CLI class that parses commands and arguments and calls the Draw program.
